Are you tired of all the general purpose fitness apps not being able to keep track of your indoor rowing results? They only take the totals and averages into account, and don't even get me started on recording ratings. Introducing 2000, an open-source Android app that makes it possible to keep track of your indoor rowing results, that unlike photos, you can actually search(coming soon), and see the progress.
